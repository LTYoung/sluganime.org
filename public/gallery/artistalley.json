I am mainly a digital artist (Clip Studio Paint Pro + Procreate) and I usually draw original character illustrations of both my and my friends' OCs. I'm hoping to work on more fanart in the future!\n\nMy interests usually revolve around rhythm games (Project Sekai currently! which intersects a bit with:), vocaloid music, and RPGMaker horror games. I also like designing original characters with friends :)\n\nMy commissions are currently closed, but I plan to open them sometime during the summer.",

    "introduction": "Hello! My name is Amirah, and I like to make things out of clay. I took a sculpture and ceramics class in high school, and I‚Äôve stuck with sculpting ever since. My favorite things to make are miniature animals, but earrings with charms seem to be the most popular at festivals and shows. I‚Äôm super excited for Slug Con, and I can‚Äôt wait to see all the amazing art in person! I didn‚Äôt table at Slug Con last year, but I went to some of the events and had a blast!",
